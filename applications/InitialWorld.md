## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Based on the Polkadot&Kusama and devoted to NFT tech in Polkadot ecosystem, Initial World is a platform integrating the creation, publication, trading, and interaction of 3D NFT and used for the application and interaction of the NFT on Polkadot ecosystem. It will become the infrastructure that connects Universe and Metaverse in the Web3.0 world supported by Substrate, Polkadot&Kusama.



Initial World will run as an platform to provide specific services. Various NFT creation templates and Initial Studio will alleviate the technical burden of developers, lower the threshold for developers, and make it more possible for the developers using Initial Studio to innovate. 



Users can use the Initial World platform to create any 2D and 3D NFT model as they like. The published NFT can be referenced in other third-party systems to extend the application or traded within the Initial World system. By using Initial Studio to create links to the SubMetaverse of Initial World, developers who want to build SubMetaverse can enjoy access to the economic models and users of Initial World.


**Initial World 3D-NFT Protocol (IWNP)**

Initial World try to dock all NFT data and in 3D model appliction, in Polkadot ecosystem.so IWNP will be designed for being upper level to or being compatible with existing NFT protocols, like RMRK on Kusama, protocols in Unique Network, ERC721 in EVM compatible parachain and etc.

**Integration**

Initial World is a platform based on IWNP and The team has also made it possible to use OCW (Off-china Worker) to obtain the external data needed by the games/DApp.


**Team Interest**

The initial Initial World Team members are loyal supporters of Web3.0. They are from different domains and backgrounds, including product managers, developers, senior managers, and the early users of encrypted currencies. Blockchain and NFT are perceived as the ideal tools by the team to build the Metaverse in the Web3.0 era. Creating and actually using NFT is not easy, and enabling NFT to circulate across chains is particularly difficult. However, assisted by Polkadot, the team believes it’s time to create a Metaverse open to all chains.


For people involved in blockchain, creating NFT is nothing new. But if every average user can create a non-homogeneous NFT circulated on all chains, numerous new ecological chemical reactions will occur. The entire team has been trying to build such a simple and easy-to-use platform for users to effortlessly create, use, save, and trade NFT, and at the same time employ NFT to construct their own spaces in the Metaverse built in Initial World. 

### Project Details

Initial World project consists of NFT Tx Analyzer, NFT Status Accessor, Resource Manager, Wormhole，Marketplace，InitialStudio and Front End.

·    **NFT Tx Analyzer** is an analyzer based on Initial World 3D-NFT Protocol (defined by Initial World Team that try to define a high level abstraction suitable for 3D model, the first inclusion will be the RMRK 2.0). It tracks the extract data and changes on the chain, analyzes them and writes them incrementally to the database, forming a real-time queryable NFT state machine

·    **NFT Status Accessor** is an intermediate layer that provides access to the state machine maintained by NFT Tx Analyzer. It can provide the native json access format in the Initial World 3D-NFT protocol, or the private access protocol defined by Initial Studio, or other custom access protocols

·    **Marketplace** is a place for users to trade NFT.

·    **Initial Studio Creator Cliert and Workspace** is a place for users and developers to create and generate NFT and send to the image library of Initial World. 

·    **Wormhole** is a space-like application created by developers to make use of the image library of Initial World (such as games, concept stores, galleries, concerts, etc.)

·    **Initial World Token $IIC** is the token of Initial World and will play a role in governance and other functions. $IIC like $DOT

·    **Resource Manager** caches all the NFT images and data stored by Initial World or the users on IPFS, S3, or other storage, is the data center of the entire platform, and accelerates the speed that games/DApp obtain data. 

·    **Front End** will adapt to the basic game front end to ensure a friendly user experience. 



**UI mock-ups**

**First SubMetaverse Template**

·    **Template Name**：Parkour

·    **Design**

◎    **Random factor**：

◎    **SubMetaverseplay**：

1. Developer creates a new Wormhole and sets regular races and daily rewards.

2. All the users can participate in the daily tasks free of charge and consume $IIC/Tickets to take part in races. 

3. After completing the daily tasks, users can receive the rewards ($IIC or NFT) set by the developer, and winners who have made it to the rankings can receive a rare or the only NFT on the entire network and enormous $IIC.

### Ecosystem Fit

There is no real NFT application and circulation platform around the world, but more NFT trading and collection platforms. What Initial World has to do is to connect NFT with Metavers, interact with people, generate value, and circulate across the entire network.
